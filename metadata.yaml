description: "Roughing It is a book of semi-autobiographical travel literature written\
  \ by American humorist Mark Twain. He wrote it during 1870–71 and published in 1872,\
  \ as a prequel to his first book The Innocents Abroad (1869). This book tells of\
  \ Twain's adventures prior to his pleasure cruise related in Innocents Abroad.\n\
  Roughing It follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the Wild West during\
  \ the years 1861–1867. After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman (not\
  \ included in the account), he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed\
  \ Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted\
  \ his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active\
  \ imagination for many stories in the book.\nRoughing It illustrates many of Twain's\
  \ early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting,\
  \ real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings\
  \ as a writer. This memoir provides examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which\
  \ would become a staple of his writing in such later books as Adventures of Huckleberry\
  \ Finn (1884), The Adventures of Tom Sawyer(1876), and A Connecticut Yankee in King\
  \ Arthur's Court (1889).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
